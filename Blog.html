            <p class="title">What does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) on styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ?</p>
            <article>
                
                <p id="pp1">
                    In css rem stands for  “root em” 
According to w3s spec the definition of one rem unite
Equal to the computed value of font-size on the root element. When specified on the font-size property of the root element, the rem units refer to the property’s initial value
This means that 1rem equals the font size of the html element (which for most browsers has a default value of 16px).

<p id="b">Rem Units vs. Em Units</p>
<p id="pp1">The main problem with em units is that they are relative to the font size of their own element. As such they can cascade and cause unexpected results. Let’s consider the following example, where we want lists to have a font size of 12px, in the case where the root font size is the default 16px:</p>
<p id="box">
    html <br>{<br>
        font-size: 100% <br>
    } <br> <br>
    ul <br>{<br>
        font-size: 0.75rem <br>
    }

</p>
<p id="pp1">If we have a list nested inside another list, the font size of the inner list will be 75% of the size of its parent (in this case 9px). We can still overcome this problem by using something along these lines:</p>
<p id="box">
    ul li <br> { <br>
        font-size:1em <br>
    }
</p>   
<p id="pp1">This does the trick, however we still have to pay a lot of attention to situations where nesting gets even deeper.
<br> With rem units, things are a simpler:
    </p>  
    <p id="box">
        html <br> { <br>
            font-size:100% <br>
        } <br><br>
        ul <br>{ <br>
            font-size: 0.75rem <br>
        }
    </p>
    <p id="pp1">
        As all the sizes are referenced from the root font size, there is no more need to cover the nesting cases in separate declarations.
    </p>  
    <p id="pp1">
        It is obvious that there are many advantages in using rem units in our code, like responsiveness, 
        scalability, improved reading experience, and greater flexibility in defining components.
        it is also a good news for developers

            <p class="title">Explain in detail(in technical terms) the specific changes in css3 
            </p>
            <article>
                <p id="pp1">CSS3 version introduced new features that allowed developers to style HTML elements with less CSS code.
                    CSS3 is backwards-compatible with former CSS versions. It means that CSS3 features work on web pages using older CSS. 
                    Browsers that support CSS2 also represent the modifications with CSS3.
                    The main difference between CSS and CSS3 is that CSS3 offers new features and separates CSS into convenient modules.
                    Also, CSS2 consisted of a single specification that defined individual features. 
                    However, separate documents (modules) introduced CSS3 features</p>
                    <p id="a">changes in css3</p>
                    <p id="b"><b><i>Box Shadow</i></b>
                    <p id="pp1">It adds a shadow to an element Instead of using multiple images around an item, 
                        this property lets you add shadow with a short line of code.</p>
                    
                    <p id="b"><b><i>Opacity</i></b></p>
                    <p id="pp1">makes elements see-through or completely transparent. <br>
                        For instance, you can apply opacity to images or other HTML elements. The transparency level depends on the indicated values
                        <br> Example: my home page profile picture </p>
                                            
                    <p id="b"><b><i>Round corner</i></b></p>
                    <p id="pp1">Before the release of CSS3, developers had to write long code to produce rounded corners. Now, it is enough to apply the
                        border-radius CSS3 property to HTML elements.
                        <br> Example: my gallery page images </p>
                    
                    <p id="b"><b><i>Attribute selector</i></b></p>
                    <p id="pp1">CSS3 also introduced new selectors in addition to the ones in CSS2. Instead of applying IDs or classes for styling, 
                        developers can select HTML elements according to their attributes. <br>
                        As a result, you do not have to create unique IDs only to apply CSS rules <br>
                        Example h1 and p selector for home page and contact page </p>
                    
                    <p id="b"><b><i>New color</i></b></p>
                    <p id="pp1">One of the CSS3 features is the addition of new colors:</p> 
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>RGBA(RED,GREEN,BLUE,ALPHA)</p></li>
                            <li>HSL
                                <p id="pp1"> HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. Unlike RGB, where you need to manipulate the saturation or brightness 
                                    of a color by changing all three-color values in concert, with HSL you can tweak either just the saturation or the 
                                    lightness while keeping the same base hue. The syntax for HSL comprises an integer value for hue, and percentage 
                                    values for saturation and lightness.
                                    — The hue in degrees from 0 to 359. Some examples are: 0 = red, 60 = yellow, 120= green, 180 = cyan, 240 = blue, and
                                    300 = magenta. <br>The a in hsla( ) here also functions the same way as in rgba( )
                                •	HSLA</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p id="pp1">Gradient Color Example: my comment page background</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    
                                             
                    <p id="b"><b><i>More than web safe font</i></b></p>
                    <p id="pp1">
                    Instead of only using fonts labeled as web-safe, developers now can apply more unique fonts in their HTML documents. 
                    Before that, CSS wanted to ensure that all browsers and machines display fonts the same</p>
